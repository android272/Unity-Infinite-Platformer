# Unity-Infinite-Platformer
A unity project to test platformer mechanics. I wanted to build a level that would generate random platforms and situations for me to test the mechanics of a platformer.

Moving left or right will create and distry the level as you move. Soon there will also be able to climb platforms infinitly upward.
